              Hi, Iâ€™m Coach Marcus a certified strength and conditioning
              specialist with over 6 years of experience helping people unlock
              their physical potential. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced
              athlete, my training philosophy is simple: build strength, move
              better, and live with purpose. I specialize in muscle building,
              fat loss, and performance training tailored to real-life goals.
              With a background in sports science and a passion for functional
              fitness, I design programs that challenge you while keeping things
              fun and injury-free. When Iâ€™m not in the gym, Iâ€™m either
              experimenting with healthy Ethiopian recipes or hiking in the
              mountains. Letâ€™s train smart and get stronger together!
            </p>

              Hello! Iâ€™m Coach Maya â€” a fitness coach and certified nutritionist
              with a heart for empowering women through wellness. My approach
              combines movement, mindset, and balanced nutrition to help you
              feel strong, confident, and energized. Iâ€™ve worked with hundreds
              of women across all fitness levels â€” from busy moms to students
              and professionals creating personalized programs that fit your
